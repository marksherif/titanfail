# Git Rules
You cant push directly to master branch fa before you start
```sh
git checkout master
git pull
git checkout -b 'branch_name'
```

Make sure you're on the master branch before pulling and creating your new branch..

Do your magic

```sh
git add . or git add 'your_file'
git commit -m "Description of your commit"
git push
```

Go to https://github.com/marksherif/titanfail and create a new pull request and assign someone as the reviewer (at least 1 review needed to merge branch with master)
